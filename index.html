    <i> <p><h3 style="color: blue;"> Online social </h3>networking website where people can create profiles,
         share information such as photos and quotes about themselves, and respond or link to the information posted by othersOn February 19, 2014, just one year after a venture capital financing round at a $1.5 billion valuation,[71] Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion, its largest acquisition to date.[21] At the time,
          it was the largest acquisition of a venture-backed company in history.[20] Sequoia Capital received an approximate 5000% return on its initial investment.[72] Facebook, which was advised by Allen & Co, paid $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and (advised by Morgan Stanley) an additional $3 billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders Koum and Acton.[73] Employee stock was scheduled to vest over four years subsequent to closing.[21] Days after the announcement, WhatsApp users experienced a loss of service, leading to anger across social media.[74]

         The acquisition was influenced by the data provided by Onavo, Facebook's research app for monitoring competitors and trending usage of social activities on mobile phones, as well as startups that are performing "unusually well".[75][76][77]
         
         The acquisition caused a considerable number of users to try and/or move to other message services. Telegram claimed that it acquired 8 million new users;[78] and Line, 2 million.[79]
         
         At a keynote presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2014, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp was closely related to the Internet.org vision.[80][81] A TechCrunch article said this about Zuckerberg's vision:
         
             The idea, he said, is to develop a group of basic internet services that would be free of charge to use – 'a 911 for the internet.' These could be a social networking service like Facebook, a messaging service, maybe search and other things like weather. Providing a bundle of these free of charge to users will work like a gateway drug of sorts – users who may be able to afford data services and phones these days just don't see the point of why they would pay for those data services. This would give them some context for why they are important, and that will lead them to pay for more services like this – or so the hope goes.[80]
         
         Just three days after announcing the Facebook purchase, Koum said they were working to introduce voice calls. He also said that new mobile phones would be sold in Germany with the WhatsApp brand and that their ultimate goal was to be on all smartphones.[82]
         
         In August 2014, WhatsApp was the most globally popular messaging app, with more than 600 million
          users.[83] By early January 2015, WhatsApp had 700 million monthly users and over 30 billion 
          
          messages every day.[84] In April 2015, Forbes predicted that between 2012 and 2018, the telecommunications industry would lose $386 billion because of OTT services like WhatsApp and Skype.[85] That month, WhatsApp had over 800 million users.[86][87] By September 2015, it had grown to 900 million;[88] and by February 2016, one billion.[89]
         
         Voice calls between two accounts were added to the app in March and April 2015.[90]
         
         On November 30, 2015, the Android WhatsApp client made links to another message service,
          Telegram, unclickable and uncopyable.[91][92][93] Multiple sources confirmed that it was
           intentional, not a bug,[93] and that it had been implemented when the Android source 
           code that recognized Telegram URLs had been identified.[93] (The word "telegram" 
           appeared in WhatsApp's code.[93]) Some considered it an anti-competitive measure
           ,[91][92][93] but WhatsApp offered no explanation. 
           Since 2016

           On January 18, 2016, WhatsApp's co-founder Jan Koum announced that it would no longer charge users a $1 annua
           l subscription fee, in an effort to remove a barrier faced by users without credit cards.[94][95] He also said that the 
           app would not display any third-party ads, 
           and that it would have new features such as the ability to communicate with businesses.[89][96]
           
           By June 2016, the company's blog reported 
           more than 100 million voice calls per day were being placed on WhatsApp.[97]
           
           On November 10, 2016, WhatsApp launched a
            beta version of two-step verification for Android users, which allowed them to use their email addresses for further
             protection.[98] Also in November 2016, Facebook ceased collecting WhatsApp data for advertising in Europe.[99] Later that month, video calls between two accounts were introduced.[100]
           
           On February 24, 2017, (WhatsApp's 8th birthday),
            WhatsApp launched a new Status feature similar to Snapchat and Facebook stories.[101]
           
           On May 18, 2017, the European Commission 
           announced that it was fining Facebook €110 million for "providing misleading information about WhatsApp takeover"
            in 2014. The Commission said that in 2014 when Facebook acquired the messaging app, it "falsely claimed it was technically impossible to automatically combine user information from Facebook and WhatsApp." However, in the summer of 2016, WhatsApp had begun sharing user information with its parent company, allowing information such as phone numbers to be used for targeted Facebook advertisements. Facebook acknowledged the breach, but said the errors in their 2014 filings were "not intentional".[99]
           
           In September 2017, WhatsApp's co-founder Brian
            Acton left the company to start a nonprofit group,[102] later revealed as the Signal Foundation, which developed
             the WhatsApp competitor Signal.[103] He explained his reasons for leaving in an interview with Forbes a year later.[104] WhatsApp also announced a forthcoming business platform to enable companies to provide customer service at scale,[105] and airlines KLM and Aeroméxico announced their participation in the testing.[106][107][108][109] Both airlines previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform.
           
           In January 2018, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Business for small business use.[110]
           
           In April 2018, WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum announced he would be leaving the company.[111] By leaving
            before November 2018, due to concerns about privacy, advertising, and monetization by Facebook,[112] Acton and Koum gave up $1.3 billion in unvested stock options.[113] Facebook later announced that Koum's replacement would be Chris Daniels.[114]
           
           Later in September 2018, WhatsApp introduced group audio and video call features.[115][116] In October, the 
           "Swipe to Reply" option was added to the Android beta version, 16 months after it was introduced for iOS.[117]
           
           On October 25, 2018, WhatsApp announced support for Stickers. But unlike other platforms WhatsApp requires 
           third-party apps to add Stickers to WhatsApp.[118]
           

           On November 25, 2019, WhatsApp announced an investment of $250,000 into the startup ecosystem through a 
           partnership with Startup India to provide 500 startups with Facebook ad credits of $500 each.[119]
           
           In December 2019, WhatsApp announced that a new update would lock out any Apple users who hadn't updated 
           to iOS 9 or higher and Samsung, Huawei, Sony and Google users who hadn't updated to version 4.0 by February 1, 2020. The company also reported that Windows Phone operating systems would no longer be supported after December 31, 2019.[120] WhatsApp was announced to be the 3rd most downloaded mobile app of the decade from 2010 to 2019.[121]
           
           In early 2020, WhatsApp launched its "dark mode" for iPhone and Android devices – a new design consisting 
           of a darker palette.[122] In March, WhatsApp partnered with the World Health Organization and UNICEF to provide messaging hotlines for people to get information on the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic.[123] That same month, WhatsApp began testing a feature to help users find out more information and context about information they receive.[124][clarification needed]
           
           In October 2020, Whatsapp rolled out a feature allowing users to mute both individuals and group chats 
           forever. The mute chat settings now show ‘8 hours', ‘1 week', and ‘Always' options. The ‘Always' option replaces the ‘1 year' option that was originally part of the settings.[125][126]
           
           In January 2021, WhatsApp announced a new Privacy Policy which users would be forced to accept by February
            8, 2021, or stop using the app. The policy would allow WhatsApp to share data with its parent company, 
            Facebook. The policy does not apply in the EU, since it violates the principles of GDPR.[127][128] Facing a
             pushback about Facebook data sharing and lack of clarity, WhatsApp postponed the update to May 15, 2021,[129][130] but announced they have no plans to limit the functionality of the app for those who don't approve the new terms or to give them persistent reminders to do so.[131]
           
           On March 1, 2021, WhatsApp started rolling out support for third-party animated stickers in Iran, Brazil
            and Indonesia.[132] On March 24, 2021, WhatsApp launched third-party animated stickers worldwide.[133]
           
           In July 2021 WhatsApp announced the development of an Android beta version update supporting the sending 
           of uncompressed images and videos in 3 options: Auto, Best Quality and Data Saver.[134] The same month,
            the Android beta enabled end-to-end encryption for cloud backups, stored in Facebook's cloud. The backup is locked by a passcode and 64-digit recovery key and cannot be accessed without them.[135] The company is also testing multi-device support, which would allow users to launch WhatsApp on their desktop devices without keeping their phone session active.[136]
           
           On October 4, 2021, Facebook had its worst outage since 2008. The outage also affected other platforms 
           owned by Facebook, such as Instagram and WhatsApp.[137][138] Security experts identified the problem 
           as possibly being DNS-related.[139]
           
           In December 2021, it was reported that WhatsApp started hiding users' online status, called "Last 
           Seen" in the app from people that are not in the user's contacts or that the user has not had a conversation with yet. The option is set by default but can be changed to allow all contacts to see a user's online status.[140] </p></i>

<h3><img src="./index.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="500"></h3>
    
<i><p>Instagram is a free social media platform for sharing photos and videos.
     Since its launch, Instagram has become a popular way to connect with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more
     
     From short-form videos to live streaming.Instagram Icon since 2016

     Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.[12] Realizing that Burbn was too similar to Foursquare, Systrom and Krieger refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among Burbn users.[13][14] They renamed the app Instagram, a portmanteau of "instant camera" and "telegram".[15]
     2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding
     
     On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[16] Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[17] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[17] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[17][18]
     
     The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 PM on July 16, 2010.[19][14] Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later at 9:24 PM. It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.[20][21][better source needed] On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store.[22]
     
     In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[23] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.[24] In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million valuation.[25] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[26]
     2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook
     
     On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[27][28] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[29] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[30][31] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were "exploring an iOS version".[32][33][34]
     
     On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock,[35][36][37] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[38][39][40] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[41] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[42] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[43]
     
     The deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[40] The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[40] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was "committed to building and growing Instagram independently."[40] According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.[44]
     
     In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality,[45] as well as a selection of badges, web widget buttons to link to profiles.[46]
     
     Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.[47][48]
     
     2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app
     
     In June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website.[49][50][51] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The slideshow banner[52][53] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.
     
     In April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app for the platform.[54][55] The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8.[56][57][58] The new app added support for videos (viewing and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages.[59] Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016.[60][61] In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a "lightweight" version of the Explore tab.[62][63]
     
     On May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, "modern" and colorful icon.[64][65][66] Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when The Verge received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept.[67]
     
     On December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to deactivate comments on a post.[68][69][70]
     
     The mobile web front end allows uploading pictures since May 4, 2017. Image filters and the ability to upload videos were not introduced then.[71][72]
     
     On April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a progressive web application (PWA) with limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020.
     2018–2019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes
     
     To comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to download an archive of their user data in April 2018.[73][74][75]
     
     IGTV launched on June 20, 2018, as a standalone video application.
     
     On September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from Instagram.[76][77] On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of Instagram.[78][79]
     
     During Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly-displayed "like" counts for content posted by other users.[80] Like counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users "worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about."[81][82] It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute to a lower self-esteem in users.[82][80] The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in July.[82][83] The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019.[84] Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service.[85]
     
     In August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the "Following" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were "surprised" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.[86][87]
     
     In October 2019, Instagram introduced a limit on the number of posts visible in page scrolling mode unless logged in. Until this point, public profiles had been available to all users, even when not logged in. Following the change, after viewing a number of posts a pop-up requires the user to log in to continue viewing content.[88][89][90]
     2020–present: New features
     
     In March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called "Co-Watching". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[91]
     
     In August 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called "Reels". The feature is similar to TikTok.[92] Instagram also added suggested posts in August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their interests from accounts they do not follow.[93]
     
     In February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be inspired by TikTok.[94] The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to stories.[95]
     
     In March 2021, Instagram launched a new feature in which four people can go live at once.[96] Instagram also announced that adults would not be allowed to message teens who don't follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[97][98][99][100]
     
     In May 2021, Instagram began allowing users in some regions to add pronouns to their profile page.[101][102]
     
     On October 4, 2021, Facebook had its worst outage since 2008. The outage also affected other platforms owned by Facebook, such as Instagram and WhatsApp.[103][104] Security experts identified the problem as possibly being DNS-related.[105]
     Negative effect on teenage girls’ mental health
     
     Facebook has known for years that its Instagram app is harmful to a number of teenagers, according to research seen by the Wall Street Journal, but the company concealed the knowledge from lawmakers.[106]
     
     Internal Facebook presentations seen by the WSJ in 2021 show that Instagram is toxic to a sizable percentage of its users, particularly teenage girls. More than 40% of Instagram's users are under 23 years old.
     
     “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” said a slide from a 2019 presentation. “Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” said another. “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”
     
     The presentations were seen by the company's executives and the findings mentioned to Mark Zuckerberg in 2020. But when asked in March 2021 about Instagram's effect on young people, Zuckerberg defended the company's plan to launch an Instagram product for children under 13.
     
     When asked by senators for its internal findings on the impact of Instagram on youth mental health, Facebook sent a six-page letter but did not include the company's research. The company told Forbes its research is “kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.”[107]
     
     In a blog post, Instagram said the WSJ story "focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light."[108]
     
     On September 27, 2021, weeks after the WSJ report was released, Facebook announced it "paused" development of Instagram Kids, the Instagram product aimed at children. The company stated it was looking into concerns raised by the regulators and parents. Adam Mosseri stated that the company would return to the project as "[t]he reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today."[109][110] </p></i>

<h3><i> <p>WhatsApp</h3>has quickly emerged as the go-to messaging app for over 1.6 billion consumers around the globe.
     It's a fast, simple, and convenient way for family and friends to chat, create group texts, share photos and videos,
      send and receive documents, and engage in private, secure conversations anytime, 
      day or night.WhatsApp is free to download messenger app for smartphones.
       WhatsApp uses the internet to send messages, images, audio or video.
        The service is very similar to text messaging services, however, 
        because WhatsApp uses the internet to send messages, 
      the cost of using WhatsApp is significantly less than texting.2009–2014

      WhatsApp was founded by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo!.
      
      In January 2009, after purch
      asing an iPhone and realizing the potential of the app industry on the App Store, Koum and Acton 
      began visiting Koum's friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose to discuss a 
      new type of messaging app that would show "statuses next to individual names of the people".[60]
       They realized that to take the idea further, they would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited
        RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.
      
      Koum named the app WhatsApp to sound like "what's up". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated[61] WhatsApp 
      Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving
       up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a "few more months".[60]
      

      In June 2009, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged when they were not using an app. 
      Koum changed WhatsApp so that everyone in the user's network would be notified when a user's status is changed.
      [25] WhatsApp 2.0 was released with a messaging component and the number of active users suddenly increased to
       250,000. Although Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company.[25] In October 2009,
        Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in seed funding, and Acton became a co-founder
         and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.[25] After months at beta stage, the 
         application launched in November 2009, exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend 
         in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later.[25] Subsequently, WhatsApp for Symbian OS was added in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010.[62] In 2010, WhatsApp was subject to multiple acquisition offers from Google which were declined.[63]
      
      To cover the cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one. 
      In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to the iOS version. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of 
      the top 20 apps in Apple's U.S. App Store.[25]
      
      In April 2011, Sequoia Capital invested about $8 million for more than 15% of the company, after 
      months of negotiation by Sequoia partner Jim Goetz.[64][65][66]
      
      By February 2013, WhatsApp had about 200 million active users and 50 staff members. Sequoia
       invested another $50 million, and WhatsApp was valued at $1.5 billion.[25] Sometime in 2013,[
       67] WhatsApp acquired Santa Clara based startup, SkyMobius, the developers of Vtok,[68] a
        video and voice calling app.[69] </p></i>
        <h2>Whatsapp web</h2>
        <h3><i><p>WhatsApp Web:-</h3>

            WhatsApp was officially made available for PCs through a web client, under the name WhatsApp Web,[160] in late January 2015 through an announcement made by Koum on his Facebook page: "Our web client is simply an extension of your phone: the web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device—this means all of your messages still live on your phone". As of January 21, 2015, the desktop version was only available to Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone users. Later on, it also added support for iOS, Nokia Series 40, and Nokia S60 (Symbian).[161][162] Previously the WhatsApp user's handset had to be connected to the Internet for the browser application to function but as of an update on October 2021 that is no longer the case.[163] All major desktop browsers are supported except for Internet Explorer. WhatsApp Web's user interface is based on the default Android one and can be accessed through web.whatsapp.com. Access is granted after the users scan their personal QR code through their mobile WhatsApp application.
            
            There are similar solutions for macOS, such as the open-source ChitChat, previously known as WhatsMac.[164][165][166]
            
            In January 2021, the limited Android beta version allowed users to use WhatsApp Web without having to keep the mobile app connected to the Internet. In March 2021, this beta feature was extended to iOS users.[167] However, linked devices (using WhatsApp Web, WhatsApp Desktop or Facebook Portal) will become disconnected if people don't use their phone for over 14 days.[168] The multi-device beta can only show messages for the last 3 months on the web version, which was not the case without the beta because the web version was syncing with the phone.[169] </p></i></h3>
